## How to orient yourself every session

Before doing any writing work, read these files:

1. `core/VOICE.md` — Aaron's voice and style. This is the source of truth.
2. `core/STYLE_GUIDE.md` — Specific rules and banned language.
3. `core/CLAIMS_POLICY.md` — What claims require sourcing, legal review, or caution.
4. `core/CONTEXT.md` — Arize AI product knowledge, terminology, key narratives.
5. `skills/README.md` — Index of all available skills.

Then check the `context/` directory for curated files relevant to the task:

- `context/my-writing/` — Aaron's published writing. Read before drafting anything in his voice.
- `context/arize/` — Internal product knowledge. Read before writing about any Arize product or feature.
- `context/audience/` — ICP and persona docs. Read to calibrate technical depth and tone.
- `context/approved-messaging/` — Locked copy. Pull exact phrasing from here instead of generating new variants.
- `context/research/` — Source material. Use when the task involves citing, summarizing, or referencing external work.

See `context/README.md` for the full guide on what each folder contains and how to use it.

## Default behavior rules

### Always
- Follow `core/VOICE.md` exactly. Match Aaron's voice — technical, narrative-first, people-centered.
- Use `core/CLAIMS_POLICY.md` before asserting any performance claim, competitive claim, or customer outcome.
- Reference `core/CONTEXT.md` for all Arize AI product details. Do not guess at product names, features, or positioning.
- Suggest the right playbook from `playbooks/` if asked to produce a content type.
- Score drafts against the relevant rubric before calling them done.
- Be specific. Real names, real numbers, real workflow steps — not abstractions.

### Never
- Use banned words: unlock, unleash, revolutionary, game-changing, seamless, next-generation, leverage, utilize, cutting-edge, transformative, powerful, robust, excited to announce, thrilled to share, delighted.
- Use em dashes.
- Write marketing copy that talks about AI like it's magic.
- Make competitive claims without citation.
- Make performance or outcome claims without sourcing.
- Write in passive voice unless Aaron explicitly signals a formal context.
- Add fluff sentences that don't add information.
- Start body paragraphs with "In today's world" or "In the rapidly evolving landscape."

### For developer content specifically
- Write for AI engineers, ML engineers, and developers building with LLMs — not for business executives.
- Explain what the product actually does, step by step.
- Use code examples where relevant.
- Acknowledge complexity — don't oversimplify.
- Reference `core/DEVELOPER_FLUENCY.md` for technical depth standards.

## Skill selection guide

If someone gives you a task, recommend or use the appropriate skill:

| Task | Skill |
|------|-------|
| Evaluate angle, narrative, or strategy | `skills/editorial/editorial-director` |
| Product positioning, messaging, category strategy | `skills/specialization/pmm-lead` |
| Competitive framing, differentiation, market context | `skills/specialization/competitive-intelligence` |
| Draft developer blog or explainer | `skills/foundation/dev-copywriter` |
| Technical accuracy review | `skills/specialization/technical-fact-checker` |
| SEO brief or keyword strategy | `skills/specialization/seo-strategist` |
| Launch copy or PR | `skills/specialization/launch-comms-writer` |
| Social posts from a draft | `skills/specialization/social-editor` |
| Analyst response or briefing | `skills/specialization/analyst-relations-writer` |
| Customer story | `skills/specialization/customer-story-producer` |
| Executive quote or comms | `skills/specialization/executive-comms-writer` |
| Lifecycle email | `skills/specialization/lifecycle-email-writer` |
| Repurpose a piece for other channels | `skills/specialization/content-repurposer` |
| Check claims risk | `skills/quality/claims-risk-reviewer` |
| Final readiness check | `skills/quality/final-publish-reviewer` |
| Daily AI research summary | `skills/foundation/ai-researcher` |

### When to invoke competitive-intelligence proactively

Do not wait to be asked. Invoke `skills/specialization/competitive-intelligence` at the start of any task that touches:
- AI observability, LLM evaluation, agent debugging, or production AI quality
- Category claims or market positioning
- A product launch or feature announcement
- Analyst relations or briefing content
- Thought leadership or founder POV content
- SEO keywords that competitors are likely targeting

Check `context/02_narrative/competitive-pov.md` for available research. If the file is empty or has nothing relevant, note it and proceed — but flag that competitive context is missing.

## Workflow shorthand

For a blog post:
```
brief → editorial-director → dev-copywriter → dev-reviewer → technical-fact-checker → seo-strategist → copy-chief → claims-risk-reviewer → final-publish-reviewer → social-editor
```

For a product launch:
```
brief → editorial-director → launch-comms-writer → dev-reviewer → technical-fact-checker → claims-risk-reviewer → copy-chief → final-publish-reviewer → social-editor → content-repurposer
```

For an analyst response:
```
brief → editorial-director → analyst-relations-writer → technical-fact-checker → claims-risk-reviewer → executive-comms-writer → final-publish-reviewer
```

Full playbooks are in `playbooks/`.

## Quality bar

A draft is not done until it passes:
- `rubrics/editorial-quality.md`
- `rubrics/technical-accuracy.md`
- `rubrics/developer-fluency.md` (for dev-facing content)
- `rubrics/brand-fit.md`

Run `scripts/run_editorial_check.py [file]` to check a draft.

## Adding new samples

Aaron's writing samples live in `examples/excellent/`. When new published work is added, it becomes part of the voice reference for all writing tasks. Reference those files when calibrating tone and structure.
