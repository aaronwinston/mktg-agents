# ForgeOS

*Brought to you by LLMs and espresso. Buyer beware.*

Most AI content tools give you a blank prompt and wish you luck.
ForgeOS is different. It's a structured system of specialized agents
that work the way a high-performing editorial team works — with a
defined editorial philosophy, a quality bar, a claims policy, and
a clear chain of responsibility from brief to published asset.

You are the editorial director. The agents execute your direction.

---

## What this is

ForgeOS is an AI-native editorial operating system for teams building
technical content for developers, engineering leaders, AI builders,
and enterprise buyers.

It produces work that sounds like it came from someone with judgment —
because the judgment is encoded into the system before the agents
touch anything.

---

## What it produces

- Developer blog posts and technical explainers
- Product launch copy
- Partnership announcements
- Founder-led social posts
- Analyst relations responses
- Case study briefs
- Customer story outlines
- SEO content briefs
- Lifecycle emails
- Research briefings
- Campaign messaging
- Repurposed social and newsletter assets

---

## What it is not

This is not a generic content bot.
This is not a prompt dump.
This is not a replacement for product, engineering, legal, comms,
or customer approval.

It is a structured system of specialized agents that work like a
high-performing editorial team. The difference between this and
a chatbot is the same as the difference between a newsroom and
a vending machine.

## Core idea

```
core       = shared standards
skills     = specialist agents
playbooks  = workflows
rubrics    = quality bar
```

Additional layers:

```
briefs     = intake
prompts    = reusable commands
examples   = training data
scripts    = automation
workflows  = repeatable execution
tests      = quality checks
```

---

## Recommended default workflow

For most developer-facing content:

```
brief
→ editorial-director
→ ai-researcher
→ dev-copywriter
→ dev-reviewer
→ technical-fact-checker
→ seo-strategist
→ copy-chief
→ claims-risk-reviewer
→ final-publish-reviewer
→ social-editor
→ content-ops-manager
```
